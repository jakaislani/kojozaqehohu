I first heard this tune about half a year ago...it was the day my ex went back to jail for theift and meth charges, which was two days after he drove me to a field and brutaly attacked me, nearly ending my life..to this day that man still holds my heart, unconditional love i guess. "Now maybe i didnt mean to treat you bad but i did it anyway" would be nearly the exact words he later told me. "And maybe some would say your life was sad but you lived it anyway" are perfect words to describe my life in the eyes of anyone but myself. " now maybe Your friends they stand around and watch you crumble as your falter to the ground, and then someday your friends they stand beside as you were flying oh you were flying oh so high" relates to the time in my life when i began using meth hevily, and my good friends and family just walked away to let me ruin myself and i entered a whole new group of friends that just stood by and helped me to ruin myself. "but then someday people look at you for what they call your own they watch you suffer ya they hear you calling home but then someday we can take the time to brush the leaves aside so you can reach us hey but you left me far behind." is exactly what i felt was happening when my family finally accepted me back after seven long years of no contact..i did not want to find the time to brush the leaves aside because they had abandoned me in my worst times...i truly felt left far behind living on the streets.."now maybe i could have made my own mistakes but i live with what i known" is how i learn. i have to physically go through the bad choices for it to affect me. "now maybe we might share in something great oh wont you look at where were from oh wont you look at where we grown" relates back to my ex...he tried to end my life and i still wanted to share a great drug free life with him and absoluty still do. "but tgen some day comes tomorrow holds a sence for what i fear for you in my mind as you trip the final line" also relates back to my ex...i fear everyday we physically fight that he is going to go over board and i am no longer going to have a life which relates to "that cold day when you lost control its a shame you left my life so soon you should have told me..but you left me far behind" the cold day when my ex looses control my family will feel it was a shame i left there life so soon..they might even wish i had told them even tho in reality i did n they turned a blind eye n left me far behind....</p><p>Id like to now say since the previous jail sentence this is no longer my life. Im still with him yes, but without all that crime n meth controling us, we live normal to what society looks as normal as. We work, we sleep, we get baked n we enjoy eachother...after it was lost forgotten and destroyed we finally found n rebuilt what made us, us.</p><p>The last thing i say is never underestamate what a child or young adult has lived through, after all...i am only 20.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rcXRopqipqSav7G%2BxK2YraGfo8Bvr86mZpyZnpm5pq7OsWafmaJir6a0yKeb</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffar-behind.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffar-behind.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffar-behind.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffar-behind.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffar-behind.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffar-behind.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./crossing-over-2009.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./crossing-over-2009.html>Crossing Over movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2009)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./biggest-skin-concerns-survey.html>Women Across The U.S. Told Us All About Their Biggest Skin Concerns</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./biggest-skin-concerns-survey.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
