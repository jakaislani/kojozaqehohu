She stabbed Charlee and Tyler in their necks, tragically ending their lives.</p><p>Brandi then turned the knife on herself but lacked the resolve to take her own life.</p><p>Following the unimaginable events, Brandi dialed 911 and chillingly confessed to the dispatcher that she had stabbed herself and killed her two children.</p><p>She subsequently contacted her mother, who rushed to the scene, her cries of anguish alerting Jason to the severity of the situation.</p><p>Brandi callously remarked to Jason, “<a href=#>Now you can’t take the kids from me.</a>”</p><p>Emergency services swiftly arrived at the scene, discovering the lifeless bodies of the children in Charlee’s bedroom, covered with blankets, while the blood-stained combat knife lay nearby.</p><p>Brandi, sitting calmly in the living room, was bleeding from a self-inflicted neck wound.</p><p>Expressing her desire to die alongside her children, Brandi received immediate medical attention and eventually recovered from her injuries.</p><p>The devastating incident left a profound impact on all those involved, forever changing their lives.</p><h2><span

Worley, who tragically took the lives of their children, the town of Darlington united in support of Jason and his family.</p><p>The community came together to organize a funeral, held at the Darlington Community Center, to honor the memories of Tyler and Charlee Worley.</p><p>The community created a GoFundMe page in a touching display of solidarity, generating $50,000 in donations to help alleviate the financial burden associated with the funeral expenses.</p><p>Community laid Tyler and Charlee to rest at Darlington’s Green-lawn Cemetery, amidst the love and grief, serving as their final resting place.</p><h2><span id=Brandi_Worley_Sentencing>Brandi Worley Sentencing</span></h2><p>Following her release from the hospital, Brandi Worley faced two felony counts of murder and was subsequently taken to <a href=#>Montgomery County Jail</a>.</p><p>Initially pleading not guilty to the charges, Brandi intended to pursue an insanity defense, prompting an order for her to undergo a psychiatric evaluation and appear for a competency hearing the following year.</p><p>However, prior to the hearing, Brandi had a change of heart and decided to plead guilty to the heinous murders.</p><p>During her sentencing, she was given the opportunity to address the court but chose not to speak.</p><p>Throughout the legal proceedings, Brandi Worley has displayed a lack of remorse for the tragic killings of her children.</p><p>She has since received a diagnosis of depression and continues to exhibit an emotionally detached state.</p><p>Presiding over the case, Judge Harry Siamas handed down a <a href=#>sentence of 120 years in prison</a> for Brandi Worley.</p><p>In his remarks, he acknowledged the search for explanations behind the senseless murders, emphasizing the profound unnaturalness of a mother taking the lives of her own children.</p><p>Judge Siamas acknowledged the presence of darkness in the world, capable of infiltrating minds and hearts, ultimately leading to such horrific acts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibnq6urMHNnaBnm5%2BifKO%2BwKebomWnpL%2Btsdho</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt"
