In 2006 and 2008, she was nominated in the Outstanding Actress in a Drama Series at the Emmy Awards for her work on “The Young and the Restless.” She also played double-duty on the series when she portrayed an additional character on the show for a few months in 2010. In 2016, she was nominated in the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series at the Daytime Emmy Awards in 2016.

For her role in that film, she was nominated in the Best Actress category at the Los Angeles Underground Film Festival.
