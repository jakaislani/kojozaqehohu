After the firelog has been extinguished, it is possible to shut the glass doors to maintain the warm air inside the home.</description></item><item><title>Easy Homemade Cranberry Sauce - Sweet and Tart!</title><link>/crockpot-cranberry-sauce.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/crockpot-cranberry-sauce.html</guid><description>Truly the BEST Cranberry Sauce recipe and it’s SO easy to make!
